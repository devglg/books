Spreadsheet to keep track of financial data for small businesses

Created in LibreOffice, may work with MS Office, but will definitely NOT work with OpenOffice because of an Array formula bug

Intended for cash accounting, it may be difficult to do accrual since I only use one account per transaction.
I recommend using quickbooks for your accounting, but if you're starting and need just something free and fast, you can use this.

TO DO:
1. Liabilities do not work completely, need a page for interest tracking.
2. Asset tracking is very simple, and only straight line, you can use double declining if you want but the formula needs to change, I'll post it later
